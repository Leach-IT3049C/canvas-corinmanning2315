## Use Cases (How to test)

* What are the application use cases? How do I test this application?
The canvas is used to display the hangman element and add each item as needed. It should 
be tested by making sure canvas is used properly with the hangman.js file.

## Self Reflection(s):
This wasn't too hard. Clearly I stil have a few issues. The arms and legs are not going 
to the right places. Other than that, I think I did a pretty good job. I could have made 
it fancier, but I ran out of time.

## How long it took me/us to finish this:
a couple of hours
